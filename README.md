## 3d Printed Face Shields for medical use

*Last update: 11:15pm EST April 3rd 2020*


This page contains information related the the materials and assembly of the 3d printed face shields I am currently manufacturing at my house.

They are based off of this design by PRUSA. [Prusa Protective Face Shield - RC3](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc2)

### Important Notice!

These shields are not manufactured in a sterile environment! While all possible measures have been taken to keep them clean as possible they are being built on my workbench at home. Please take the proper precautions listed below.

Here is a guide on how to properly sterilize the Face Shields before use: [Prusa Face Shield disinfection](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/prusa-face-shield-disinfection_125457)

### Statistics Totals

```

Total Shields Printed
- PETG - 42
- PLA - 8 (Non Medical Grade Material. For personal use only)

```

### Statistics by Day

```
Apr 3 - Failed attempt to increase production has caused my 3d printer to fail on subsequent prints. I believe this is due to filament jam. and resulting nozzle misalignment. I will endeavor to recalibrate the printer as soon as time allows. The loss of productivity by trying to gain speed has caused production to cease unacceptably. From this point forward I will only print the tried and true files and have had a 100% success rate previously. It is not worth the downtime in my opinion. Better to have 6 face shields a day than try for 16 and have 3 days downtime.

Mar 31 - 6 PETG Orange - Failed to increase production by printing 8 shields at a time with max printer speed

### Materials Used In Manufacture

- The frame is constructed of PETG plastic filament. Link [OVERTURE PETG Filament 1.75mm with 3D Build Surface 200 x 200 mm 3D Printer Consumables, 1kg Spool (2.2lbs), Dimensional Accuracy +/- 0.05 mm, Fit Most FDM Printer (Orange)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VJYL11F/)
- The clear face shield is made of common office laminate sheets. 2 sheets have been laminated together for stiffness.
- The strap is made from common Velcro. Link [Monoprice 3-Pack Hook & Loop Fastening Tape 5 Yard/roll, 0.75-inch, Black-(121887), 3 Piece](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WW3LSLT/)

### Supplies Needed
I am still trying to find the best material to use as the clear face shield potion. I am not totally pleased with the clarity and flimsiness of the laminate material. If you have any materials that may work better please send me an email at the link below.
*Update*
I have received 200 sheets of clear acrylic that can be used for the shields. I have also received 15 more rolls of velcro. This should allow me to produce 100+ more shields.
